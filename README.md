# NECSC24

## Nebraska Cyber Security Conference - Talk Slides &; Content

This-two part talk is a condensed sample from a 16hr training course Jordan and Kent teach, offered by AntiSyphonTraining.com.

In the two sessions we will give an overview into what we call threat optics: auditing endpoints, centralizing logs and visualizing results.

Each student will leave the class having experienced a penetration test through three distinct perspectives, each building on the previous. These will include adversarial attacks, examination of defensive postures, and wrapped up with various detection methodologies using open-source or free industry threat detection and defenses.
